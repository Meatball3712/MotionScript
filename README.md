# MotionScript
Python scripts that use images and the pillow library to stitch together animations from a config. Flipbook style.

A super simple set of scripts that can take a number of png images and stitch them together in layers according to a story to create simple
animation effects.

For example, you can take 3 images and pan them over each other to create a simple paralax effect.

Why?
Because I'm a professional programmer, and an amateur animator.

No real reason for it. I just find it easier to manipulate images with numbers and mathematics rather than manually lining things up.

Still under development.
